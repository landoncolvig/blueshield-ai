## Tips for Using Radio Codes

### DO:
- ✅ Use 10-27/10-29 together for efficiency (most common)
- ✅ Provide full name and DOB when requesting checks
- ✅ Use Code 4 when scene is secure
- ✅ Use 10-23 when you arrive on scene
- ✅ Use proper radio etiquette

### DON'T:
- ❌ Forget that backup officer HEARS everything
- ❌ Use codes you don't understand
- ❌ Assume dispatcher will know what you want without proper codes

### Common Combinations:
- "10-23" → "10-27/10-29 on subject" → "Code 4"
- "511" → "10-27/10-29" → "10-42" (traffic stop to arrest)
- "415F" → "10-23" → "907" → "Code 4" (domestic violence call)
